It consists of a basic hilt constructed from whatever material was available to the builder, typically metal or composites. Simple weapons, though still exceedingly elegant, all lightsabers are equipped with some form of kyber crystal. Kyber crystals are actually a broad family of different types of crystals. Though these can vary in shape and coloration, and even certain properties, kyber crystals share certain unique attributes. These attributes allow kyber crystals to be used within lightsabers, enabling them to focus the lightsabers' power into their signature energy blades.

Although he succeeded in <a title=\"Death\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death\">killing</a> the former, Maul was defeated and maimed by Jinn's apprentice, who left the <a title=\"Sith Lord\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord\">Sith Lord</a> for <a title=\"Death\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death\">dead</a>. As a result of Maul's defeat and apparent death, Sidious replaced him with <a title=\"Count\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Count\">Count</a> <a title=\"Dooku\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dooku\">Dooku</a>, Jinn's <a title=\"Jedi\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi\">Jedi</a> mentor who adopted the Sith persona of Darth Tyranus.</p>\n<p>Fueled by his hatred for Kenobi, Maul survived and reconstructed himself as a <a title=\"Cyborg\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cyborg\">cyborg</a>, although the experience of his defeat also drove him insane. He was presumed dead for over a <a title=\"Standard decade\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_decade\">decade</a> until his brother, <a title=\"Savage Opress\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Savage_Opress\">Savage Opress</a>, found Maul and restabilized his <a title=\"Brain\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brain\">mind</a> with the help of Mother Talzin. By that <a title=\"Time\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Time\">time</a>, the <a title=\"Clone Wars\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars\">Clone Wars</a> raged across <a title=\"The galaxy\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy\">the galaxy</a>, with the <a title=\"Jedi General\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_General\">Jedi-led</a> <a title=\"Grand Army of the Republic\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic\">clone forces</a> of the Republic battling the <a title=\"Separatist Droid Army\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Separatist_Droid_Army\">droid armies</a> of the <a title=\"Confederacy of Independent Systems\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems\">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a> as intended by Maul's former <a title=\"Sith Master\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Master\">Sith Master</a>. Believing he had been cheated out of his place in <a title=\"Timeline of galactic history\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history\">galactic history</a>, Maul embarked on a personal quest for revenge against Kenobi, whom he blamed for his fate. He also used the <a title=\"Galaxy\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy\">galactic</a> conflict as an opportunity to form his own criminal empire, the <a title=\"Shadow Collective\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Collective\">Shadow Collective</a>, through various alliances, which included the <a title=\"Pyke Syndicate\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pyke_Syndicate\">Pyke Syndicate</a>, the <a title=\"Black Sun\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Sun\">Black Sun</a>, the <a title=\"Hutt Clan\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt_Clan\">Hutt Clan</a>, and the <a title=\"Mandalorian\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalorian\">Mandalorian</a> <a title=\"Death Watch\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Watch\">Death Watch</a>. Their combined resources enabled Maul to <a title=\"Takeover of Mandalore\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Takeover_of_Mandalore\">overthrow</a> the <a title=\"New Mandalorians\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/New_Mandalorians\">New Mandalorians</a> and install a puppet <a title=\"Politics\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Politics\">government</a> on <a title=\"Mandalore\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalore\">Mandalore</a>. However, as his power and influence increased, Maul became a threat to Sidious' own <a title=\"Proclamation of the New Order\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_New_Order\">plans</a> for the <a title=\"Imperial Era\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Era\">future</a>. The Dark Lord confronted Maul in person; after killing Opress, Sidious denounced his former apprentice as a Sith no longer due to the <a title=\"Rule of Two\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rule_of_Two\">Rule of Two</a>. Despite Maul's efforts to avenge his brother, he was defeated and overpowered by Sidious' command of the Force.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the waning <a title=\"Standard day\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_day\">days</a> of the <a title=\"Cloning\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cloning\">Clone</a> Wars, Maul <a title=\"Escape from the Spire\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_from_the_Spire\">escaped</a> from Sidious and ultimately returned to Mandalore where he was <a title=\"Siege of Mandalore\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Mandalore\">overthrown</a> by former Padawan <a title=\"Ahsoka Tano\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano\">Ahsoka Tano</a> and an <a title=\"Unidentified Galactic Republic division\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_Galactic_Republic_division\">army</a> of <a title=\"Clone trooper\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_trooper\">clone troopers</a>. However, Maul survived the war and continued to build his own empire as a <a title=\"Crime lord\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crime_lord\">crime lord</a> and the secret leader of <a title=\"Crimson Dawn\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Dawn\">Crimson Dawn</a>. He was later stranded on the <a title=\"Planet\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet\">planet</a> <a title=\"Malachor\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malachor\">Malachor</a>, where he hoped to destroy the Sith by unlocking the <a title=\"Superweapon\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Superweapon\">superweapon</a> at the heart of the <a title=\"Malachor Sith Temple\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malachor_Sith_Temple\">Sith temple</a>. Maul's plan was thwarted by two Jedi, <a title=\"Kanan Jarrus\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus\">Kanan Jarrus</a> and <a title=\"Ezra Bridger\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ezra_Bridger\">Ezra Bridger</a>, the latter of whom Maul hoped to corrupt as his own apprentice. After escaping Malachor, Maul continued to try to tempt Bridger to the dark side before ultimately learning that Kenobi was still alive in spite of <a title=\"Order 66\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66\">Order 66</a> and the <a title=\"Great Jedi Purge\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Jedi_Purge\">Great Jedi Purge</a>. Seeking hope and purpose, Maul sought Kenobi on <a title=\"Tatooine\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\">Tatooine</a>, the same planet where he had first revealed himself to Kenobi. In <a title=\"2 BBY\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/2_BBY\">2 BBY</a>, Maul engaged Kenobi in a brief <a title=\"Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_to_Tatooine_(Imperial_Era)\">lightsaber duel</a> for the last time. Kenobi cut Maul's lightsaber in half and dealt Maul a lethal blow, ending Maul's decade-spanning quest for vengeance. He died moments later with the knowledge that Kenobi was protecting <a title=\"Luke Skywalker\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker\">Luke Skywalker</a>, who Kenobi believed was the <a title=\"Chosen One\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chosen_One\">Chosen One</a>, taking comfort in the fact that it meant the Sith would be destroyed.&nbsp;</p>","species":{"value":"Dathomiran

or Sith lightsabers, the dangerous double-bladed I ightsabers were first designed by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire. Double-bladed lightsabers consist of an oversized lightsaber hilt equipped with an upgraded power supply and twin emitter systems and crystals, one at either end of the hilt. When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes fight multiple foes at once. Although quite dangerous and effective in combat, double-bladed lightsabers are also exceptionally difficult to master. Nevertheless, some Jedi constructed double-bladed lightsabers for themselves, including some notable figures in ancient Jedi myth. \n[P]Although technically, this weapon contains two lightsaber crystals (one for each blade), for the purposes of gameplay it is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Hum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points. \n[P]When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This represents the fact that the double-bladed lightsaber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end).

Good for only one shot, the blaster mechanism focuses all of its power into a single, high-powered blast that can penetrate most armor and can incapacitate or even kill the toughest opponent in the blink of an eye. Despite their utility, wrist blasters have a number of downsides. They are illegal on most worlds, although that doesn't stop individuals from using them. In addition, their range is pitifully short: users must be almost touching their target for the weapon to have any effect. Finally, since wrist blasters are only good for one shot, a user is put in a precarious situation if the blast fails to incapacitate or kill the intended target. \n[P]Noticing that an individual is wearing a wrist blaster requires a [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI]) Perception check[b].

The droid's <a title=\"Photoreceptor/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Photoreceptor/Legends\">photoreceptors</a> were mounted on a long, thin telescopic stalk, from which protruded various tool-tipped appendages. The standard WED droid had sockets to support up to six manipulators, though variants carried eight or more. These limbs were easy to install and replace, and Cybot Galactica actively encouraged consumers to purchase a variety of appendages for their Treadwells.</p>\n<p>Extending from the body is a telescoping neck, which supports a head made up of a pair of binocular photoreceptors capable of magnifying objects up to one thousand times. The Treadwell has a primitive vocabulator that enables it to warble and hoot in a machine language understood by most other droids.</p>\n<p>With their long arms, Treadwells can reach areas inaccessible to stubby-bodied astromechs. And the price is hard to beat.

Kits are also useful for repairing damaged droids or cybernetic parts, especially ones too modified to take to reputable mechanics. Tool kits need to have a wide range of gear, as many users are fond of tinkering and upgrading on their own. Basic hammers, hydrospanner wrenches, restraining bolts, power coupling scrubbers, fusion cutters, laser and sonic welders, replacement wiring and components, power calibrators, and of course welding goggles and heavy gloves are all standard components. Many of these also make for effective improvised weapons. For those used to doing extensive repairs, some kits include diagnostic probes and other aids to determine the nature of the fault. There is little a skilled mechanic cannot fix with a well-maintained and well-stocked toolkit, given adequate time to conduct the repairs (which is sometimes a problem too). \n\n[P]Toolkits allow mechanics to perform most Mechanics checks to repair mechanical devices, and can also be used to \"heal\" droids. \n\n[P][B]Models Include:[b] Numerous Variants.","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":"4","type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":"350","type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":"2","type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{}},"sort":200000}]}

This was a risky position, as any recruit they approached could potentially be an Imperial agent. Even the best agent would inevitably approach the wrong person after a few years in the field.</p>\n<p>The Rebel Alliance recruited personnel from many sources. Recruits for the many <a title=\"Sector Force\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sector_Force\">Sector Forces</a> tended to be recruited by friends or relatives already in the SecForce's underground networks. Since these recruits were brought in by someone who knew them well, they were much less likely to be Imperial agents. Other Rebel personnel were recruited in large numbers from planets with governments which openly or covertly supported the Alliance, such as <a title=\"Dac\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dac\">Mon Calamari</a> or the various Rebel <a title=\"Safe world/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Safe_world/Legends\">safe worlds</a>. Many <a title=\"Alderaanian/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaanian/Legends\">Alderaanians</a> who escaped the <a title=\"Destruction of Alderaan\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Destruction_of_Alderaan\">destruction of Alderaan</a> also joined the Rebellion. However, these sources were not enough, especially in the early days of the <a title=\"Galactic Civil War/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Civil_War/Legends\">Galactic Civil War</a>. Thus, recruitment agents were needed to bolster the Alliance's ranks.</p>\n<p>Rebel recruitment agents found recruits in many schools, universities, and even the <a title=\"Imperial Naval Academy\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Naval_Academy\">Imperial Naval Academy</a>. They also recruited disgruntled <a title=\"Imperial Survey Corps/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Survey_Corps/Legends\">Imperial Survey Corps</a> personnel, young men and women dodging the Imperial draft, and even members of <a title=\"The galaxy/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy/Legends\">the galaxy's</a> criminal underground.</p>\n<p>On many planets, a 10,000 <a title=\"Galactic Credit Standard\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Credit_Standard\">credit</a> reward was offered for any recruitment agent turned over to the Imperial authorities. Simply being captured or killed was not the worst thing that could happen to a recruitment agent who made a mistake, however. The Empire had been known to feed double agents to known recruiters, with disastrous consequences for numerous Rebel outposts. However, the Alliance was able to spot many of these double agents during training. Besides, dissatisfaction with the Empire was widespread, and the Alliance continued to gain legitimacy as the Rebellion went on. The <a title=\"Battle of Yavin/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin/Legends\">Battle of Yavin</a> is credited with a 23 percent increase in Rebel

Sniper Rifle","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]E-11S Sniper Rifle[h3]\n\nDeveloped from the venerable E-11 blaster rifle, BlasTech's E-11s was designed primarily as a dedicated marksman's rifle for use by the Galactic Empire. A large, sleek, and deadly-looking weapon, the E-11s is nearly as long as a grown human is tall, with a shroud-ed barrel that makes up fully half of its length. Excellent balance and precision-fit components help compensate for this, however, and the E-11 s is quite easy to carry and shoot for a weapon of its size. The E-1Is is incredibly popular among the Empire's scout and reconnaissance forces, whose missions typically see them operating in conditions where the long range and pinpoint accuracy of a dedicated sniper weapon can be used to their fullest potential. In the field, the E-11s grants a small reconnaissance squad incredible reach and allows them to project their force at ranges unmatched by most military units. Officially, the E-11 s carries a restricted rating, limiting it to governmental, military, and law-enforcement use only. That being said, more than a few of these powerful rifles have fallen out of the backs of speeder trucks, so to speak. Those that have found their way into civilian hands make for excellent hunting and sniping weapons, and their performance nearly makes up for the serious risks involved in owning them. \n\n[P]E-11s rifles are equipped with relatively light-weight, matte-finish composite furniture that absorbs light, a fixed stock, and a powerful multioptical telescopic sight. The rifle's firing mechanism uses a supercharged actuating module, upgraded exciter, and extremely volatile, highly compressed blaster gasses to increase the range and penetration of the blaster bolt. This extra power has the added side effect of reducing refraction and beam degradation, allowing it to maintain both its penetration and stopping power at incredible range. While this makes for a powerful weapon, especially in the hands of a talented marksman, it also makes for a weapon that consumes quite a bit of energy and as such has a limited ammunition capacity (a rarity in blasters).

The main difference was in their height - at 0.96 meters, the R2-series was less than half as high than the hulking P2. Like its forerunners, the R2 astromech was designed to work in and around space vessels as a diagnostic and repair unit. But unlike the clunky <a title=\"R1-series astromech droid/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/R1-series_astromech_droid/Legends\">R1-series</a> or the overly large P2-series, this rounded, waist-high droid was made specifically to fit in military <a title=\"Starfighter/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Starfighter/Legends\">starfighter</a> astromech slots. This was a radical departure, as previously all such droids had been dedicated government models.

Although he succeeded in <a title=\"Death\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death\">killing</a> the former, Maul was defeated and maimed by Jinn's apprentice, who left the <a title=\"Sith Lord\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Lord\">Sith Lord</a> for <a title=\"Death\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death\">dead</a>. As a result of Maul's defeat and apparent death, Sidious replaced him with <a title=\"Count\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Count\">Count</a> <a title=\"Dooku\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dooku\">Dooku</a>, Jinn's <a title=\"Jedi\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi\">Jedi</a> mentor who adopted the Sith persona of Darth Tyranus.</p>\n<p>Fueled by his hatred for Kenobi, Maul survived and reconstructed himself as a <a title=\"Cyborg\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cyborg\">cyborg</a>, although the experience of his defeat also drove him insane. He was presumed dead for over a <a title=\"Standard decade\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_decade\">decade</a> until his brother, <a title=\"Savage Opress\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Savage_Opress\">Savage Opress</a>, found Maul and restabilized his <a title=\"Brain\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Brain\">mind</a> with the help of Mother Talzin. By that <a title=\"Time\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Time\">time</a>, the <a title=\"Clone Wars\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_Wars\">Clone Wars</a> raged across <a title=\"The galaxy\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy\">the galaxy</a>, with the <a title=\"Jedi General\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_General\">Jedi-led</a> <a title=\"Grand Army of the Republic\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Grand_Army_of_the_Republic\">clone forces</a> of the Republic battling the <a title=\"Separatist Droid Army\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Separatist_Droid_Army\">droid armies</a> of the <a title=\"Confederacy of Independent Systems\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Confederacy_of_Independent_Systems\">Confederacy of Independent Systems</a> as intended by Maul's former <a title=\"Sith Master\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sith_Master\">Sith Master</a>. Believing he had been cheated out of his place in <a title=\"Timeline of galactic history\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_galactic_history\">galactic history</a>, Maul embarked on a personal quest for revenge against Kenobi, whom he blamed for his fate. He also used the <a title=\"Galaxy\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galaxy\">galactic</a> conflict as an opportunity to form his own criminal empire, the <a title=\"Shadow Collective\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Shadow_Collective\">Shadow Collective</a>, through various alliances, which included the <a title=\"Pyke Syndicate\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pyke_Syndicate\">Pyke Syndicate</a>, the <a title=\"Black Sun\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Sun\">Black Sun</a>, the <a title=\"Hutt Clan\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hutt_Clan\">Hutt Clan</a>, and the <a title=\"Mandalorian\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalorian\">Mandalorian</a> <a title=\"Death Watch\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Death_Watch\">Death Watch</a>. Their combined resources enabled Maul to <a title=\"Takeover of Mandalore\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Takeover_of_Mandalore\">overthrow</a> the <a title=\"New Mandalorians\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/New_Mandalorians\">New Mandalorians</a> and install a puppet <a title=\"Politics\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Politics\">government</a> on <a title=\"Mandalore\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mandalore\">Mandalore</a>. However, as his power and influence increased, Maul became a threat to Sidious' own <a title=\"Proclamation of the New Order\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Proclamation_of_the_New_Order\">plans</a> for the <a title=\"Imperial Era\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Era\">future</a>. The Dark Lord confronted Maul in person; after killing Opress, Sidious denounced his former apprentice as a Sith no longer due to the <a title=\"Rule of Two\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Rule_of_Two\">Rule of Two</a>. Despite Maul's efforts to avenge his brother, he was defeated and overpowered by Sidious' command of the Force.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In the waning <a title=\"Standard day\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Standard_day\">days</a> of the <a title=\"Cloning\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Cloning\">Clone</a> Wars, Maul <a title=\"Escape from the Spire\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Escape_from_the_Spire\">escaped</a> from Sidious and ultimately returned to Mandalore where he was <a title=\"Siege of Mandalore\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Siege_of_Mandalore\">overthrown</a> by former Padawan <a title=\"Ahsoka Tano\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano\">Ahsoka Tano</a> and an <a title=\"Unidentified Galactic Republic division\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Unidentified_Galactic_Republic_division\">army</a> of <a title=\"Clone trooper\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Clone_trooper\">clone troopers</a>. However, Maul survived the war and continued to build his own empire as a <a title=\"Crime lord\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crime_lord\">crime lord</a> and the secret leader of <a title=\"Crimson Dawn\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Crimson_Dawn\">Crimson Dawn</a>. He was later stranded on the <a title=\"Planet\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Planet\">planet</a> <a title=\"Malachor\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malachor\">Malachor</a>, where he hoped to destroy the Sith by unlocking the <a title=\"Superweapon\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Superweapon\">superweapon</a> at the heart of the <a title=\"Malachor Sith Temple\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Malachor_Sith_Temple\">Sith temple</a>. Maul's plan was thwarted by two Jedi, <a title=\"Kanan Jarrus\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus\">Kanan Jarrus</a> and <a title=\"Ezra Bridger\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ezra_Bridger\">Ezra Bridger</a>, the latter of whom Maul hoped to corrupt as his own apprentice. After escaping Malachor, Maul continued to try to tempt Bridger to the dark side before ultimately learning that Kenobi was still alive in spite of <a title=\"Order 66\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Order_66\">Order 66</a> and the <a title=\"Great Jedi Purge\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Jedi_Purge\">Great Jedi Purge</a>. Seeking hope and purpose, Maul sought Kenobi on <a title=\"Tatooine\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Tatooine\">Tatooine</a>, the same planet where he had first revealed himself to Kenobi. In <a title=\"2 BBY\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/2_BBY\">2 BBY</a>, Maul engaged Kenobi in a brief <a title=\"Mission to Tatooine (Imperial Era)\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Mission_to_Tatooine_(Imperial_Era)\">lightsaber duel</a> for the last time. Kenobi cut Maul's lightsaber in half and dealt Maul a lethal blow, ending Maul's decade-spanning quest for vengeance. He died moments later with the knowledge that Kenobi was protecting <a title=\"Luke Skywalker\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Luke_Skywalker\">Luke Skywalker</a>, who Kenobi believed was the <a title=\"Chosen One\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Chosen_One\">Chosen One</a>, taking comfort in the fact that it meant the Sith would be

or Sith lightsabers, the dangerous double-bladed I ightsabers were first designed by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire. Double-bladed lightsabers consist of an oversized lightsaber hilt equipped with an upgraded power supply and twin emitter systems and crystals, one at either end of the hilt. When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes fight multiple foes at once. Although quite dangerous and effective in combat, double-bladed lightsabers are also exceptionally difficult to master. Nevertheless, some Jedi constructed double-bladed lightsabers for themselves, including some notable figures in ancient Jedi myth. \n[P]Although technically, this weapon contains two lightsaber crystals (one for each blade), for the purposes of gameplay it is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Hum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points. \n[P]When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This represents the fact that the double-bladed lightsaber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end). However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules. \n[BR][B]Models Include:[b] None; each of these weapons is individually constructed.","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":18600,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":true},"skill":{"value":"Lightsaber","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":9,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Engaged","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeEngaged"},"special":{"value":"<p>BREACH 1,LINKED 1,SUNDER ,DEFENSIVE 1</p>","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":100000},{"_id":"5sUIe7T8ODipK6KO","flags":{"importid":"MKINIGHTSTALKER SUIT"},"name":"Mk I NightStalker Suit","type":"armour","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Bantin Corp Mk I NightStalker Infiltrator Suit[h3]\nThe Mk I NightStalker is a lightweight, surprisingly durable suit of armor that Bantin Corp recently produced.

Their most remarkable feature was their immense strength, able to carry objects many times their own size or weight. This enabled them to repair automata such as <a title=\"Podracer/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Podracer/Legends\">Podracers</a> at a remarkable pace. Their skeletal design and long, thin limbs were dwarfed by their broad-flared, dome-shaped heads. In the center of their head was a large, round <a title=\"Photoreceptor/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Photoreceptor/Legends\">photoreceptor</a> equipped with multi-spectrum scanners. The photoreceptor could detect microscopic damage in metals and other solids.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EV_1-6\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DUM-series_pit_droid/Legends#cite_note-EV-1\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The DUM-series worked best in large groups, and had built-in comm systems that allowed them to communicate with those in their unit. The antenna on their disk shaped heads served to transmit directions to other droids, allowing a group of droids to collaborate on a project more efficiently and thereby expediting its completion.<sup id=\"cite_ref-EV_1-7\" class=\"reference\"><a href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/DUM-series_pit_droid/Legends#cite_note-EV-1\">[2]</a></sup> Their immense strength would make a malfunctioning (or unattended) unit extremely hazardous, possibly resulting in significant damage. The most hazardous of these was a damaged ON/OFF button, the risk of which caused many owners to keep <a title=\"Ion cannon/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Ion_cannon/Legends\">ion</a> <a title=\"Blaster/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Blaster/Legends\">blaster</a> on hand as a precautionary measure.

Most fire proton-charged warheads designed to destroy small transports, but other types of ammunition can occasionally be found. \n\n[P]Missile tubes are elaborate affairs, equipped with micro-repulsorlifts that make them easier for infantry soldiers to carry, as well as advanced tracking screens to detect a target's speed, range, and energy signature. The latter is particularly important because missile tubes can be fired in one of three modes. The first is infrared, which homes in on a craft's heat signature. The second is gravity-activated mode, which means it tracks a target's repulsorlift. Both of these modes can be spoofed, either by dropping burning flares to distract heat sensors or small repulsorlift pods as chaff. See the Guided weapon quality to handle these two modes of attack. \n\n[P]The third firing method is direct-fire. This requires more skill but sends the projectile in a straight line that cannot be spoofed by chaff or flares (and loses the Guided quality). Of course, if another target happens to get in the way, or if the attacker's aim is off, the missile will hit whatever is in its path without discrimination. Missile tubes require one preparation maneuver before firing. \n\n[BR][B]Models Include[b]: Merr-Sonn PLX-2M Missile Tube.

or Sith lightsabers, the dangerous double-bladed I ightsabers were first designed by the Dark Lords of the Old Sith Empire. Double-bladed lightsabers consist of an oversized lightsaber hilt equipped with an upgraded power supply and twin emitter systems and crystals, one at either end of the hilt. When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes fight multiple foes at once. Although quite dangerous and effective in combat, double-bladed lightsabers are also exceptionally difficult to master. Nevertheless, some Jedi constructed double-bladed lightsabers for themselves, including some notable figures in ancient Jedi myth. \n[P]Although technically, this weapon contains two lightsaber crystals (one for each blade), for the purposes of gameplay it is treated as having a single crystal. This lightsaber is a double-bladed lightsaber hilt containing an unmodded Hum lightsaber crystal (see page 197). This crystal occupies two of the weapon's hard points. \n[P]When purchasing attachments for this weapon (including crystals), each attachment costs double the listed price. This represents the fact that the double-bladed lightsaber generally requires two of each attachment (one for each end). However, when installing and modding these attachments, follow all normal rules. \n[BR][B]Models Include:[b] None; each of these weapons is individually constructed.","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":18600,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"skill":{"value":"Lightsaber","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Engaged","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeEngaged"},"special":{"value":"<p>BREACH 1,LINKED 1,SUNDER</p>","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":100000},{"_id":"5sUIe7T8ODipK6KO","flags":{"importid":"MKINIGHTSTALKER SUIT"},"name":"Savage's Nightbrother Robes","type":"armour","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Bantin Corp Mk I NightStalker Infiltrator Suit[h3]\nThe Mk I NightStalker is a lightweight, surprisingly durable suit of armor that Bantin Corp recently produced.

A large, intimidating weapon, the BR-219 has a short, thick barrel with a broad aperture, a heavy-duty frame, and a custom grip with an integral recoil compensation system. These super-heavy pistols were developed in response to requests from bounty hunters and law enforcement agencies for a powerful, pistol-sized weapon for use in taking down particularly dangerous opponents. To meet the demand, BlasTech turned to one of its most popular and well-respected product lines and developed the BR-219 from its E-11 series of millitary blaster rifles.\n[P]Using the E-11's reciever and firing mechanism, BlasTech engineers then reengineered the XCiter and actuating module to produce an overcharged bolt, equipped the drastically shortened barrel with an improved Galven pattern, and developed a special and highly volatile blend of blaster gases to feed their new weapon. All of this enhanced technology combined with the new bespoke blaster gas made for an extremely powerful—if slightly inaccurate and finicky—pistol. The bolt from the BR-219 is nearly as powerful as the E-11, and the weapon produces a tremendous noise and muzzle flash when fired. It is neither a subtle nor a restrained weapon; openly carrying one of these massive pistols makes an eloquent point about the user's intentions.\n[P]The BR-219 is not sold through BlasTech's usual dealer network. Instead, the weapon must be custom ordered straight from the factory. A thorough Imperial Security Bureau background check and a specially issued carry permit are required to purchase one of these weapons legally. Of course, this background check can be circumvented by purchasing the pistol on the black market or acuiring it through other less-than-legal means. Carrying a BR-219 without the proper permit is a risky business, and being found with an illegally purchased model is grounds for immediate Imperial imprisonment. Using a BR-219 in combat for an extended period of time is,  to the least, quite hazardous. The immense heat generated by the high-performance blaster gas and the overcharged action of the firing mechanism put an incredible amount of strain on the weapon.\n[P]GMs may spend [TH][TH] from a check to cause the BR-219 to become damaged one step (undamaged to minot, minor to moderate, etc.) and suffer the penalties listed on page 166 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] Core Rulebook until repaired.

Lighter and shorter than its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle, the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars. This makes them very attractive to more cash-strapped members of the Rebel Alliance. \n\n[P]During combat, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an E5 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).

Lighter and shorter than its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle, the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars. This makes them very attractive to more cash-strapped members of the Rebel Alliance. \n\n[P]During combat, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an E5 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).

Privateers tended to hold themselves to a more \"civilized\" standard than other pirates, and restricted their activities to specific targets. Most pirates were orphans or citizens that were unemployed because of either being uneducated or having a lust for adventure, riches or anarchy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on a few occasions, pirates have pulled through to help the galaxy as a whole.

The ion cannon could disable an entire ship, making it easier to board and loot. Some pirate gangs operated as two groups: the boarding group and the attack group. The attack group would disable the ship and its weapons, and the boarding group would breach the ship's hull to steal or plunder whatever they could find (credits, chronos, comlinks and blasters).</p>\n<p>Some pirates lent their services to other organizations, such as the <a title=\"Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends\"

Other pirates, referred to as \"<a title=\"Privateer/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Privateer/Legends\">privateers</a>,\" operated under the sanction of governments or organizations like the <a title=\"Alliance to Restore the Republic/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alliance_to_Restore_the_Republic/Legends\">Alliance to Restore the Republic</a>. Privateers tended to hold themselves to a more \"civilized\" standard than other pirates, and restricted their activities to specific targets. Most pirates were orphans or citizens that were unemployed because of either being uneducated or having a lust for adventure, riches or anarchy.</p>\n<p>Indeed, on a few occasions, pirates have pulled through to help the galaxy as a whole.

The ion cannon could disable an entire ship, making it easier to board and loot. Some pirate gangs operated as two groups: the boarding group and the attack group. The attack group would disable the ship and its weapons, and the boarding group would breach the ship's hull to steal or plunder whatever they could find (credits, chronos, comlinks and

reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles. \n\n[P]A throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients. However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as \"Legacy Arms,\" has proven modestly successful, especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons, whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers. \n\n[P]One of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip. Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending on the customer's tastes. \n\n[P]New rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization. \n\n[P]Once the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]).","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":3000,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":true},"skill":{"value":"Ranged: Heavy","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Extreme","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeExtreme"},"special":{"value":"ACCURATE 2,PIERCE 3","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":200000},{"_id":"bihFVHBV6TaCsWYD","flags":{"importid":"VIBKN"},"name":"Vibroknife","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]Vibroknife[h3]\n\nA vibroknife is essentially a modded combat knife, but since they have proven so effective, they have become manufactured as such throughout the galaxy.

reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles. \n\n[P]A throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients. However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as \"Legacy Arms,\" has proven modestly successful, especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons, whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers. \n\n[P]One of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip. Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending on the customer's tastes. \n\n[P]New rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization. \n\n[P]Once the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]).","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":3000,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":true},"skill":{"value":"Ranged: Heavy","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Extreme","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeExtreme"},"special":{"value":"ACCURATE 2,PIERCE 3","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":200000},{"_id":"bihFVHBV6TaCsWYD","flags":{"importid":"VIBKN"},"name":"Vibroknife","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]Vibroknife[h3]\n\nA vibroknife is essentially a modded combat knife, but since they have proven so effective, they have become manufactured as such throughout the galaxy.
