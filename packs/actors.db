This was a risky position, as any recruit they approached could potentially be an Imperial agent. Even the best agent would inevitably approach the wrong person after a few years in the field.</p>\n<p>The Rebel Alliance recruited personnel from many sources. Recruits for the many <a title=\"Sector Force\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Sector_Force\">Sector Forces</a> tended to be recruited by friends or relatives already in the SecForce's underground networks. Since these recruits were brought in by someone who knew them well, they were much less likely to be Imperial agents. Other Rebel personnel were recruited in large numbers from planets with governments which openly or covertly supported the Alliance, such as <a title=\"Dac\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Dac\">Mon Calamari</a> or the various Rebel <a title=\"Safe world/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Safe_world/Legends\">safe worlds</a>. Many <a title=\"Alderaanian/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Alderaanian/Legends\">Alderaanians</a> who escaped the <a title=\"Destruction of Alderaan\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Destruction_of_Alderaan\">destruction of Alderaan</a> also joined the Rebellion. However, these sources were not enough, especially in the early days of the <a title=\"Galactic Civil War/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Civil_War/Legends\">Galactic Civil War</a>. Thus, recruitment agents were needed to bolster the Alliance's ranks.</p>\n<p>Rebel recruitment agents found recruits in many schools, universities, and even the <a title=\"Imperial Naval Academy\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Naval_Academy\">Imperial Naval Academy</a>. They also recruited disgruntled <a title=\"Imperial Survey Corps/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Imperial_Survey_Corps/Legends\">Imperial Survey Corps</a> personnel, young men and women dodging the Imperial draft, and even members of <a title=\"The galaxy/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/The_galaxy/Legends\">the galaxy's</a> criminal underground.</p>\n<p>On many planets, a 10,000 <a title=\"Galactic Credit Standard\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Galactic_Credit_Standard\">credit</a> reward was offered for any recruitment agent turned over to the Imperial authorities. Simply being captured or killed was not the worst thing that could happen to a recruitment agent who made a mistake, however. The Empire had been known to feed double agents to known recruiters, with disastrous consequences for numerous Rebel outposts. However, the Alliance was able to spot many of these double agents during training. Besides, dissatisfaction with the Empire was widespread, and the Alliance continued to gain legitimacy as the Rebellion went on. The <a title=\"Battle of Yavin/Legends\" href=\"https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_Yavin/Legends\">Battle of Yavin</a> is credited with a 23 percent increase in Rebel

Using a patented dual-circuit galven pattern, an overcharged X-citer, and a powerful mix of blaster gases, the HH-50 fires both barrels with one pull of the trigger, allowing it to pierce the thickest hide. The downside to all of this stopping power is that the HH-50 is incredibly inefficient, even for a heavy blaster pistol, and tends to run its blaster gas chamber dry at the most inopportune times. \n\n[P]During combat, Game Masters may make an HH-50 run out of ammunition by spending [TH][TH].

Designed as a competitor to Adostic Arms' 8-gauge \"AA8\" scattergun, the Thunderhead is the latest word in close-quarters combat weaponry. Based on an ancient and simple slug-throwing technology, the Thunderhead is a rifle-sized, semi-automatic, smoothbore weapon that fires clouds of small ferroalloy pellets instead of bolts, slugs, or other traditional projectiles. When used in enclosed spaces, such as ship compartments, building corridors, and the like, these weapons are extremely effective against both unarmored and lightly armored targets.\n[P]Unlike the AA8, which relies on a large-bore shell with a large number of inert pellets, the Model 4 uses a smaller shell that is packed with tiny explosive pellets. This makes for a smaller, easier-to-handle weapon than the M8, with a lighter recoil and increased ammunition capacity. It also gives the weapon the ability to crack open light armor and vehicles and take down powerful beasts like gundarks and rancors. Czerka also sells a variety of different ammo types for the Thunderhead-everything from flechette rounds to inert shot to non-lethal gel rounds-providing users with a great amount of versatility on the battlefield.","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":700,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"skill":{"value":"Ranged: Heavy","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Short","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeShort"},"special":{"value":"BLAST 5,KNOCKDOWN ,VICIOUS 1","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":600000},{"_id":"yvgDVO6PgSqo3HnH","flags":{"importid":"JETPACK"},"name":"Jet Pack","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]Jet Pack[h3]\n\nA jet pack is ideal for fast maneuverability and surprise attacks.

Sniper Rifle","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]E-11S Sniper Rifle[h3]\n\nDeveloped from the venerable E-11 blaster rifle, BlasTech's E-11s was designed primarily as a dedicated marksman's rifle for use by the Galactic Empire. A large, sleek, and deadly-looking weapon, the E-11s is nearly as long as a grown human is tall, with a shroud-ed barrel that makes up fully half of its length. Excellent balance and precision-fit components help compensate for this, however, and the E-11 s is quite easy to carry and shoot for a weapon of its size. The E-1Is is incredibly popular among the Empire's scout and reconnaissance forces, whose missions typically see them operating in conditions where the long range and pinpoint accuracy of a dedicated sniper weapon can be used to their fullest potential. In the field, the E-11s grants a small reconnaissance squad incredible reach and allows them to project their force at ranges unmatched by most military units. Officially, the E-11 s carries a restricted rating, limiting it to governmental, military, and law-enforcement use only. That being said, more than a few of these powerful rifles have fallen out of the backs of speeder trucks, so to speak. Those that have found their way into civilian hands make for excellent hunting and sniping weapons, and their performance nearly makes up for the serious risks involved in owning them. \n\n[P]E-11s rifles are equipped with relatively light-weight, matte-finish composite furniture that absorbs light, a fixed stock, and a powerful multioptical telescopic sight. The rifle's firing mechanism uses a supercharged actuating module, upgraded exciter, and extremely volatile, highly compressed blaster gasses to increase the range and penetration of the blaster bolt. This extra power has the added side effect of reducing refraction and beam degradation, allowing it to maintain both its penetration and stopping power at incredible range. While this makes for a powerful weapon, especially in the hands of a talented marksman, it also makes for a weapon that consumes quite a bit of energy and as such has a limited ammunition capacity (a rarity in blasters). These rifles also emit an enormous amount of heat when firing, thanks to their supercharged firing systems. To compensate for this, the E-11 s has a slow rate of fire to allow for cool-down, and the barrel is insulated with a triple-redundant nitrogen cooling system.

Nearly the size of a blaster carbine, and sharing a number of parts and systems with the Clone Wars-era DC-15 blaster carbine, the HH-50 is the largest, heaviest, highest-output blaster pistol currently produced by BlasTech. Popular with beast riders, vehicle crews, and cavalry scouts, the HH-50 packs a blaster rifle's worth of stopping power into a relatively small and easy to use package. Using a patented dual-circuit galven pattern, an overcharged X-citer, and a powerful mix of blaster gases, the HH-50 fires both barrels with one pull of the trigger, allowing it to pierce the thickest hide. The downside to all of this stopping power is that the HH-50 is incredibly inefficient, even for a heavy blaster pistol, and tends to run its blaster gas chamber dry at the most inopportune times. \n\n[P]During combat, Game Masters may make an HH-50 run out of ammunition by spending [TH][TH]. This is in addition to the standard spending of [DE]. In addition, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an HH-50 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":1300,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"skill":{"value":"Ranged: Light","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Short","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeShort"},"special":{"value":"STUNSETTING ,LINKED 1,VICIOUS 1","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":600000},{"_id":"ZD129OOFmg2Z1cbw","flags":{"importid":"HUTTSHELLARMOR"},"name":"Hutt Shell Armor","type":"armour","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]Hutt Shell Armor[h3]\n\nCrafted especially for the Shell Hutts of Circumtore, these massive exoskeletons are fashioned from segmented cylinders of durasteel.

reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles. \n\n[P]A throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients. However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as \"Legacy Arms,\" has proven modestly successful, especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons, whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers. \n\n[P]One of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip. Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending on the customer's tastes. \n\n[P]New rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization. \n\n[P]Once the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]).","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":3000,"type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":true},"skill":{"value":"Ranged: Heavy","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Extreme","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeExtreme"},"special":{"value":"ACCURATE 2,PIERCE 3","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":200000},{"_id":"bihFVHBV6TaCsWYD","flags":{"importid":"VIBKN"},"name":"Vibroknife","type":"weapon","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]Vibroknife[h3]\n\nA vibroknife is essentially a modded combat knife, but since they have proven so effective, they have become manufactured as such throughout the galaxy.

A large, intimidating weapon, the BR-219 has a short, thick barrel with a broad aperture, a heavy-duty frame, and a custom grip with an integral recoil compensation system. These super-heavy pistols were developed in response to requests from bounty hunters and law enforcement agencies for a powerful, pistol-sized weapon for use in taking down particularly dangerous opponents. To meet the demand, BlasTech turned to one of its most popular and well-respected product lines and developed the BR-219 from its E-11 series of millitary blaster rifles.\n[P]Using the E-11's reciever and firing mechanism, BlasTech engineers then reengineered the XCiter and actuating module to produce an overcharged bolt, equipped the drastically shortened barrel with an improved Galven pattern, and developed a special and highly volatile blend of blaster gases to feed their new weapon. All of this enhanced technology combined with the new bespoke blaster gas made for an extremely powerful—if slightly inaccurate and finicky—pistol. The bolt from the BR-219 is nearly as powerful as the E-11, and the weapon produces a tremendous noise and muzzle flash when fired. It is neither a subtle nor a restrained weapon; openly carrying one of these massive pistols makes an eloquent point about the user's intentions.\n[P]The BR-219 is not sold through BlasTech's usual dealer network. Instead, the weapon must be custom ordered straight from the factory. A thorough Imperial Security Bureau background check and a specially issued carry permit are required to purchase one of these weapons legally. Of course, this background check can be circumvented by purchasing the pistol on the black market or acuiring it through other less-than-legal means. Carrying a BR-219 without the proper permit is a risky business, and being found with an illegally purchased model is grounds for immediate Imperial imprisonment. Using a BR-219 in combat for an extended period of time is,  to the least, quite hazardous. The immense heat generated by the high-performance blaster gas and the overcharged action of the firing mechanism put an incredible amount of strain on the weapon.\n[P]GMs may spend [TH][TH] from a check to cause the BR-219 to become damaged one step (undamaged to minot, minor to moderate, etc.) and suffer the penalties listed on page 166 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] Core Rulebook until repaired. In addition, Game Masters may spend [DE] to cause the BR-219 to melt down and explode, destroying the weapon and dealing the weapon's base damage to the user.","quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":"2","type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum"},"price":{"value":"625","type":"Number","label":"Price"},"rarity":{"value":"7","type":"Number","label":"Rarity"},"attributes":{},"hardpoints":{"value":"2","type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP"},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":true},"skill":{"value":"Ranged: Light","type":"String","label":"Skill"},"damage":{"value":"8","type":"Number","label":"Damage","abrev":"Dam"},"crit":{"value":"3","type":"Number","label":"Critical Rating","abrev":"Crit"},"range":{"value":"Short","type":"String","label":"SWFFG.WeaponRangeShort"},"special":{"value":"STUNSETTING ,VICIOUS 2","type":"String","label":"Special"}},"sort":200000},{"_id":"doVCg5vZdwdgT6j8","flags":{"importid":"HBA"},"name":"Heavy Battle Armor","type":"armour","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"description":"\n      [H3]Heavy Battle Armor[h3]\n\nCertain heavy stormtroopers, bounty hunters, and even droids are fitted with heavy armor.

Lighter and shorter than its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle, the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars.
