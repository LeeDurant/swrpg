Thank you for Downloading this Custom Token Marker Set!

These can be used on Roll20 as overlays for tokens to show a variety of effects. I have named each image to what it can be used for, although please feel free to use them however you wish.

The images I have used have been taken from all over, I claim to not own the art, I merely modified them to be appropriate for a token set.

For things like marking speed. Minion number, or even number of dice to add, you can actually add a number to the marker by pressing 0 to 9 while hovering over the marker on Roll 20. Not a lot of people know this!

However, I will attempt to describe what you do.

-Log into Roll20

-From the menu at the top, click 'Tools > Token Marker Library'

-There should already be "Default Token Markers", you can leave these and press 'create' at the bottom, give it a name and press 'create set'

-You should be taken to a page where you a prompted to add images.

-Upload the images one by one, please note that the order you upload them determines the order they appear in the token box, so you might want to selectively upload them one at a time.

-Once you are done, save the token set.

-To add it to a game, go to the games info page (where you can see the description, addons, when the next game is etc) on the right should be a little box called 'Token Marker Sets' click the add button and select the set you made.

-You are ready to go! I would recommend removing the default token set unless you already use that. However, I found that it wasn't quite adequate.

Thank You!
