Installation Guide

    Open the Foundry application
    Double check that you have installed the latest OggDude's dataset.
         *not doing so may cause certain values to be missing from the module!*
    Go to "Add-On Modules" tab
    Click "Install Module" button at the bottom.
    Paste the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeeDurant/swrpg/Prod/module.json
    Click "Install"
    Activate the module in your World using Manage Modules under the Game Settings tab.
    
Usage Notes
   
    Tokens and characters have been developed using stats from http://swa.stoogoff.com and include
    background entries either written by the contributors or from Wookiepedia. They do not need to 
    have species or specifications added to be fully functional, as they were assembled prior to
    those functions being fully supported in the proper FFG-SWRPG module for FoundryVTT.
    
    Tokens have vision activated, allowing them to be dropped right into your game and have lines-of-
    sight (LoS) already configured within the FoundryVTT dynamic lighting system. LoS will depend 
    on the headgear of the token and physical eye placement on the species of the token in question.
    For the best experience using this effect, we recommend downloading Forien's Token Rotation
    module.
    
    I, or any other authors or contributors, are not responsible for changes that may result from updates,
    hot fixes or changes that may occur in the compendiums that may affect your game. It is recommended
    that you back up the module before updating to ensure that there are no issues with forward compatability.
    
    
    This is an on-going project that has grown out of a personal interest to have a more portable set of data
    for the FFG-SWRPG system. Changes, content and more may reflect that personal interest. We will do our best
    to maintain authenticity to previous statted characters as provided by either FFG or the fan community, but
    please understand if you discover some changes or discrepencies that this is a free project and provided
    as such.

Future Plans
    
    We will be adding as many characters as possible, with the hopes of using all of the tokens within the
    module's token folder. If folders are ever supported for actors, we will do our best to categorize them
    as well into eras, classes or species.
