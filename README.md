Usage Notes
   
    I, or any other authors or contributors, are not responsible for changes that may result from updates,
    hot fixes or changes that may occur in the compendiums that may affect your game. It is recommended
    that you back up the module before updating to ensure that there are no issues with forward compatability.
    
    This is an on-going project that has grown out of a personal interest to have a more portable set of data
    for the FFG-SWRPG system. Changes, content and more may reflect that personal interest. We will do our best
    to maintain authenticity to previous statted characters as provided by either FFG or the fan community, but
    please understand if you discover some changes or discrepencies that this is a free project and provided
    as such.
